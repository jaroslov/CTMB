A stone-washed jeans era role-playing game: we didn't have GTA, so we did this, instead.

Some people may know this game by the totally useless name 'MILITARY' since, originally,
we'd had HUGE plans on making a hyper-accurate tactical combat simulation game.

HOO, BOY, THE SETTING---
    Your party wakes up in a ditch, you remember nothing, and you're fuckin' ANGRY & BROKE.

In most cases, the game begins once the party has acquired the following, in any order:
    1. Cheesy-bean burritos from a fast food joint;
    2. A car, or other vehicle (tractor, motorcycle, helicopter); and,
    3. Sufficient weapons & ammo to knock over a small military depot.
Side effects of acquiring the above should be considered at length by the GM, and not
at all by the players.

The time setting the game should be played in is the `90s, but with some
Knight Rider/Airwolf/6-million dollar man tech thrown in. Y'know, all the reruns.

The game ends (you win) when the whole party goes out in a blaze of glory. For instance, you
win gold in the group figure skating in the Olympics, after 'convincing' the IOC to add group
figure skating to the Olympics. If someone in the party member has the audacity to die a bit
too soon, you're going to need to figure that out.

Making a character---
    You're only going to need a single piece of paper. There's a few major mechanical parts:
    1. A homunculus with body points;
    2. Raw hit point pool;
    3. Your damage reduction rating; and,
    4. A set of skills.

The homonculus---
    Draw a homunculus (a generic person), and label the following parts with body points:
head - 2, neck - 1, upper arm - 3, lower arm - 2, hand 1, upper leg - 4,
lower leg - 3, foot - 2; the body is split into upper-left and upper-right torso, each with 5
points, and a lower torso/belly with 5 points. Also, make a chunk of the upper-left torso with
0 points. That's your heart, in case you get stabbed/shot there. Make fun of anyone who puts
the heart on the left-hand-side of the homonculus, rather than the right.

Raw hit point pool---
    You get 17.

Damage reduction rating (DR)---
    You get 0.

Skills---
    Generally, you get 30 'points' to spend on skills. A skill can be anything. Notice that there's
no attributes, so if you want to be strong, buy the 'strength' skill. If you want to be really
ridiculously strong, buy 10 points of the strength skill. Alternately, if you want to be the
deadlift bro, buy a few points in deadlift. If you want magic, buy some skill in magic; if you'd
like to be able to throw a fireball, buy the fireball skill (after you get the magic skill; or,
before, if you don't care about personal safety). Martial arts needs a skill. Shooting a gun
needs a skill. Driving a car like a `60s spy needs a skill level or two.

The following skills are called out:
    1 point buys a body point on one part of the body.
    1 point buys a hit point.
    17 points buys a level of DR.

Probably, it's a good idea if someone in your group has cybernetic prosthesis/surgeon skill. Or,
even better, the skill to contact one.

Giving & taking damage---
    All strikes (for lethality) target one (or more) body parts. Each point of damage is subtracted
from both the body part and the raw hit point pool. A character dies when their raw hit point
pool is less than -10. A body part becomes inactive/useless when reduced to 0 points. It has to
come off (surgically) if it ever goes below 0 points. It's removed for you if it's value drops
to the negative of its value. That is, if you're stabbed in the hand for 1 point, you can't use
your hand. If you're stabbed again, your hand it mutilated to be point it needs to be removed.
The third stab removes the hand for you.

Before applying damage to body points, subtract your DR from the damage.

Combat (and skill use, in general)---
    Narrate your action. Given a description of what you're doing, the GM will determine which of your
skills apply to the given situation. In general, the player with the most (and most total number)
of skills (and skill levels) applied to the situation wins. If there's doubt, roll a 1D20;
the higher value wins. There are no ties, try again.

Use the following table as a guide for damage---
    Untrained strikes - 0 body point damage, 1 point raw hit point.
    Trained strikes - 1 point per level.
    Knife - 1 point.
    Hand-weapons - 1D4 points.
    Hand-gun - 1D6 points.
    Rifle - 2D6 points.
    Grenade - 3D6 points to all parts exposed.

Character progression---
    Yeah. No. Points, I guess.

                    +-----------------------------------+

P.S.---
    There used to be a bunch of attributes, but we never used them, and I've forgotten, precisely,
what they were. So, to simplify the whole part where you keep asking me what the attributes are,
I've just left them off. If you're really keen on attributes, then go ahead and use:

    Strength
    Dexterity
    Speed
    Intelligence

You get 10 points in each. You can spend a skill point to raise an attribute by one point. The
only game-effecting attribute is 'speed' which lets your character eat a cheesy bean burrito
a bit faster than your buddies. That's not part of the original game, by the way.
